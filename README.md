Gutenberg Modifications
=======================

-For this part of the assignment, I largely followed the recommendations to achieve an old look. I chose a yellowish-white colour in an attempt to achieve a paper-like background. I also chose a gothic-type font, specifically Century Gothic. I think the aesthetic worked nicely for the horror novels I chose (Frankenstein and Dracula). To my eye, the font suits the Shakespeare collection nicely as well.
